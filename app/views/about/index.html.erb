      Using the site is simple: enter a lawmaker’s name, issue topic
      or bill number to search OpenCongress. Get information on who
      represents you, find relevant legislation and learn how to take
      action. Check out House and Senate profile pages to see what bills
      lawmakers sponsor, voting records, campaign contributions and how to
      contact them. You can even
      review side-by-side comparisons on how members vote in the current
      Congress. OpenCongress also provides quick links for bills based on

      joint project with the Sunlight Foundation until acquired by
      the Sunlight Foundation in 2013. Sunlight is now the sole operator of OpenCongress
