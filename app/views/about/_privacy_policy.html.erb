<h2 id="privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
The Sunlight Foundation values your privacy. When you trust us with your
personal information, we take that responsibility seriously. Here’s what we
hope is a readable summary of the most important parts of our Terms of
Service and Privacy Policy:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>
  We will never sell, rent, share or distribute your personal information
  without your permission.
  </li>
  <li>
  We only collect and store your personal information for login purposes and
  in order to stay in touch with you, and to provide you with the services you choose
  to employ on our site.
  </li>
  <li>
  You can remove yourself from our website whenever you want.
  </li>
  <li>
  We collect analytics about how people use our tools. We use that
  information to improve them, and we sometimes share it with reporters,
  funders and others. But we only share that information at an aggregate
  level; we never share information about individual users.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you use our APIs, we would like your permission to talk about it--this
  helps us secure the resources necessary to keep them going. If you don’t
  like the sound of this, you can opt out of it when you sign up for an API
  key.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Also, hopefully this stuff goes without saying:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Our tools sometimes link to other sites. We are not responsible for the
  privacy practices of those sites, and recommend you read their privacy
  policies for further information.
  </li>
  <li>
  We do our best to provide excellent, reliable and accurate information
  through our tools and services. But nobody’s perfect, and if you encounter
  a problem we’d like to hear about it from your bug report, not your lawyer.
  Everything we publish is offered as-is, without warranty or guarantee.
  </li>
  <li>
  We believe in open source, and we publish things under a variety of open
  licenses. But we have to protect our branding and trademarks; you shouldn’t
  use them to imply that your project is affiliated with us unless you’ve
  gotten our written permission to do so.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
